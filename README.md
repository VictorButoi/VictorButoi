- ğŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Victor! I'm currently a PhD student at MIT studying machine learning.
- ğŸ“ˆ I'm interested in both building and understanding learning systems which are flexible to new tasks.
- ğŸ§  One place that this paradigm is critically useful is Medical Imaging, where I've done quite a bit of work, and is the main topic of research in my labs.
